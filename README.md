# BlackPink theme motivational to do list 
#This hobby project was crafted for my esteemed friend, Alexander Cheng, a leading Toronto food critic and influencer. Alex's culinary critiques cover an impressive spectrum, from humble hole-in-the-wall eateries to prestigious 3-star Michelin restaurants. His gastronomic journey extends from the remote corners of rural Asia to the bustling metropolises of major cities around the globe. This project aims to assist Alex in organizing his reviews and culinary adventures with elegance and efficiency.

# He is also a big time BlackPink fan!
